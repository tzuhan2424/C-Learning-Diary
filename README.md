# C lang learning Diary
This is the repo for me to practice C programming language  
About myself: 
I have several programming language experience and have full stack development experience  
and understand a little bit assembly language, due to LC3.
Also, I know about basic data structure and algorithms. I would probably analyze the complexity, who knows.  

programming experience  
fluent: python, Java  
normal: C#, javascript, php  


This diary is my learning journey for learning C lang, and document how I would learn new language as a experienced developer.  

My Goal for learning C: OS development, Robotics, embedded system development.
