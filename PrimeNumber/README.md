# Prime Number

5/1
I think before jump directly into coding, I must know the structure.

1. include
`include <filename>`: Used for system header files or libraries that come with the compiler. The compiler searches for these files in its predefined directories.
`include "filename"`: Used for user-defined header files. The compiler searches for these files in the current directory first, then in the system directories.
2. int main()
return type
in main, return int, seems like is a standard
there are other return type, such as basic datatype(float..), void, you could return pointer as well(Cool)



3. Ok, so how do I get user input
